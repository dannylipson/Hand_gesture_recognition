# Hand_gesture_recognition

In the real world, getting a clean data set is never that easy. More than half the work in applying machine learning is finding, gathering, cleaning, and formatting  data set.

The purpose of this project is to gain experience gathering my own data set, and understand the challenges involved in the data cleaning process.

American Sign Language

American Sign Language (ASL) is a complete, complex language that employs signs made by moving the hands combined with facial expressions and postures of the body. It is the primary language of many North Americans who are deaf and is one of several communication options used by people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.

This project focuses on classifying a subset of these hand gesture images using convolutional neural networks. Specifically, given an image of a hand showing one of the letters A-I, we want to detect which letter is being represented.

For this project, the hand gestures of the previous batch data set is used for each class of the alphabets 28 members image with various lighting and orientation was provided.
